# Transforming-Code-AI-Powered-C-Pseudocode-Translator-


## 📌 Overview  
This project is an **AI-powered Transformer-based Translator** that converts **C++ code to Pseudocode and vice versa** using a **deep learning** model. Built using **PyTorch** and **Streamlit**, this tool helps students, educators, and developers automate code translation while maintaining logic and structure.  

## ✨ Features  
- 🔄 **Convert C++ to Pseudocode & Pseudocode to C++**  
- ⚡ **Uses Transformer-based Seq2Seq Model**  
- 🎨 **Modern UI built with Streamlit**  
- 🧠 **Deep learning-powered fast & accurate translation**  
- 🚀 **Easy-to-use and open-source**  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** Streamlit  
- **Backend:** PyTorch, Transformers  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Model:** Transformer-based Seq2Seq
